# Implementation Prompt: Vision Implementation

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Create Changes Tracking File

You WILL create `20251122-vision-implementation-changes.md` in #file:../changes/ if it does not exist.

### Step 2: Execute Implementation

You WILL follow #file:../../.github/instructions/task-implementation.instructions.md
You WILL systematically implement #file:../plans/20251122-vision-implementation-plan.instructions.md task-by-task
You WILL follow ALL project standards and conventions

**CRITICAL**: If ${input:phaseStop:true} is true, you WILL stop after each Phase for user review.
**CRITICAL**: If ${input:taskStop:false} is true, you WILL stop after each Task for user review.

### Step 3: Cleanup

When ALL Phases are checked off (`[x]`) and completed you WILL do the following:
  1. You WILL provide a markdown style link and a summary of all changes from #file:../changes/20251122-vision-implementation-changes.md to the user:
    - You WILL keep the overall summary brief
    - You WILL add spacing around any lists
    - You MUST wrap any reference to a file in a markdown style link
  2. You WILL provide markdown style links to .copilot-tracking/plans/20251122-vision-implementation-plan.instructions.md, .copilot-tracking/details/20251122-vision-implementation-details.md, and .copilot-tracking/research/20251122-vision-audit-research.md documents. You WILL recommend cleaning these files up as well.
  3. **MANDATORY**: You WILL attempt to delete .copilot-tracking/prompts/implement-vision-implementation.prompt.md
