Is XP spending implemented? If not, it should be. If so, we should have a way to withdraw it even if our current "balance" is 0.

Unable to update any task. They always say "failed to update" after trying to mark one complete

This doesn't seem true. I don't see anything in the settings or anywhere else to advance the day. We need to make that available.

You have 18 days to process. Visit Settings to advance the date and apply any pending penalties.

Somewhere in this dashboard we need to show the current date and the date that is being processed

Recurrence Pattern

We need another recurrence setting. Something like "recurrence style". Which is either (hopefully with slicker terminology):

﻿

Next scheduled date: Recurs on next scheduled date regardless of when the current instance is completed. (New due date = old due date + recurrence pattern)
After completion date: Recurs at a "distance" from the completion of the current instance (New due date = old COMPLETION date + recurrence pattern)
﻿

And then probably also something along the lines of how to handle missed due dates:

Keep existing task: Do nothing. Do not create a new task. Current task is overdue.
Move existing task: Reschedule current instance according to recurrence pattern. 
Create new instance: Existing instance remains unmodified and overdue. Another instance is created according to the recurrence pattern.

Recurring Habit

recurrence should be possible even for non-habits. Habits are basically just an additional tracking toggle.

Edit Task

We need to audit the "edit task" screen in general for size consistency

When editing a recurring task, we should display when the next recurrence would be.

The check box column doesn't seem to do anything in the task table view. Logically, it should either mark a task complete or be a bulk editing thing.

In the task table view, there is an unnecessary circle button to the left of the task name that doesn't seem to do anything

Home Owner

The project for tasks in the card view unnecessarily overflows to a new line. It should be on the same line as everything else.

The edit button seems to open a new task rather than editing the task it's a part of, which is what it should do.

Invalid Date

All of the dates in the card view of the Tasks screen show "Invalid Date". The date is fine in the table view.

Tasks

I'd argue that we don't need this title bar per screen on the top. I think just the selection on the left is good enough.
